# Data Architectures: Exam Project

## Abstract

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, a cutting-edge architecture that combines information retrieval with generative AI. The project uses **Python**, leveraging tools such as **Chroma** for document retrieval, **Hugging Face Transformers** for language modeling, and **PyTorch** for training and inference. 

The methodology includes:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring a dataset derived from 31,000 research papers published on arXiv, focusing on AI-related domains.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying key patterns in publication trends, topic distribution, and collaboration networks.
- **System Design**: Implementing an Advanced RAG architecture with query optimization and embedding-based document retrieval.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating the performance of GPT-2 Large and Flan-T5 models in generating context-aware and accurate responses.

### Final Implications
The developed RAG system enhances generative AI capabilities by integrating external knowledge bases, reducing hallucinations, and improving response relevance. This approach showcases the potential of hybrid architectures in tackling real-world information retrieval and natural language processing challenges.
